        <h3>Here's what we know about the famous pirate:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the irreverent 
            trickster of the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety,
            a master of self-promotion and self-interest, Jack fought a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies.
            Jack's first love was the sea, his second, his beloved ship the Black Pearl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The son of Captain Edward Teague, Jack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship in a typhoon.
            Before he was known as "Captain Jack Sparrow", he was simply known as Jack, a teenage stowaway who,
            even then, had a desire for adventure. Jack first sailed on the Barnacle with a young ragtag crew on a
            quest to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Cortés. As a young pirate he earned the name Jack Sparrow
            when he trapped the notorious Spanish pirate hunter Capitán Salazar in the Devil's Triangle. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Over the course of time, Captain Jack Sparrow became a center of intrigue as myths and legends have been told
            of his exploits. Most of these tales, however, were exaggerations, or even fabrications, embellished by Jack himself
            to bolster his reputation. Despite his dishonesty and many deceptions, Jack Sparrow did embark on a number of grand and
            thrilling adventures, some involving the supernatural, pirate lore, magic, and journeys in discovering hidden treasures.
            Indeed, Jack's ultimate ambition was to have the freedom to sail the seas as a legendary pirate for eternity.</li>
